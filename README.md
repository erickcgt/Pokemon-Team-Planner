# Pokemon Team Planner
This project is a web app that pulls relevant data from an API called PogoAPI (https://pogoapi.net). This data is then parsed and organized. Users can search Pokemon by name and filter them by several data points. Additionally, users can add up to 6 Pokemon to a UI panel that hovers at the top of the webpage, allowing them to plan out a team for Pokemon games. The UI provides a lot of visual aid such as color coding image backgrounds by the type of the Pokemon. The UI resizes according to screen size so it is functional even on mobile devices.
